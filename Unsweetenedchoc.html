    <h1>Unsweetened Chocolate</h1>
    <p>
            Unsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate.
            
            It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong,
             deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which 
             sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cacao, 
             is always dark and a minimum of 75% cacao
            Unsweetened "Baking" Chocolate
            Poorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar and/or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed
