    <p>
            White chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids. Because of this, many countries do not consider white chocolate as chocolate at all.
            "White chocolate" contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.
