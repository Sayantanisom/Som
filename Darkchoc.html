    <h1>Dark Chocolate</h1>
    <p>
            Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture. The U.S. Food and 
            Drug Administration calls this "sweet chocolate", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate
             liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[34] A higher amount of cocoa solids 
        indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is a dark chocolate with a low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[citation needed] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017, there is no high-quality 
            evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health 
            benefits
