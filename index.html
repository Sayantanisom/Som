<h1>The chocolate World</h1>
<h2> Exploring the sweet world of Chocolate</h2>
Chocolate is a usually sweet, brown food preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds 
that is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient
 in other foods.
 <div="history">
 <h2>History</h2>
 <p>Chocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history.
      For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz,
       Mexico, dates chocolate's preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC. On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cacao beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC   </p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<img src="./images/choc3.jpg" src="image of choc"/>
<p>Roughly two-thirds of the entire world's cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from
     CÃ´te d'Ivoire,[38] where, as of 2007, child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.
     [39][40] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world 
     depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[41] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase 
     their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[42] 
     According to the WCF's 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.
     [43] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cacao beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). 
     Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.)</p>
